## About
![zebra_fantm_gradient_bluepink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25969533/113354706-2a603600-9305-11eb-895e-efa2f219848f.png) 
[FANTM](https://getfantm.com) is creating easy-to-use EMG (muscle-based) interfaces for you and your computer. The DEVLPR is an Arduino shield that will make it so that you too can start playing around with EMG and all of the possibilities it opens up, whether it be for games, robotics, or something we've never thought of. Once we have the hardware in a functional state we plan on adding software libraries to make the device plug-and-play with Arduino and make it easy for the DEVLPR to be integrated into other projects. 

We're just two engineers who have a passion for new tech and Open Source, so share and build away!

## Disclaimer
This hardware is a major work in progress right now. We are still mid development cycle, and the board in its current state likely does not work. Once it is in a stable state we will tag a release but until then it's going to be frequently changing (and improving).

## Getting Started
This library relies on digikeys KiCAD symbol/footprint library, and they have been included as a submodule. This means when cloning with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FANTM/DEVLPR`. If something goes wrong, the [git submodules documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) is always helpful.
